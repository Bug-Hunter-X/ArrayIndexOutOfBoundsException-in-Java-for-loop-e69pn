This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common coding error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The bug is in the for loop's condition and the solution demonstrates how to correct it to avoid this runtime exception.  The error occurs when trying to access an element outside the valid index range of an array.
